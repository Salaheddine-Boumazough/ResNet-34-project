# ResNet-34-project
This project features a complete, from-scratch implementation of the ResNet-34 architecture using TensorFlow and Keras. It demonstrates a deep-dive into modern Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) design, specifically the application of residual learning to solve the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.
